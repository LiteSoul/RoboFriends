Meet your RoboFriends!

My first React app, which fetchs user data and images to create the card stack of little Robots (fetch remote json as a promise, grab bots from robohash.org).
You can search by the bots' names or jobs (symply array.includes inside array.filter, with some magic from React event listener).

Built with Create React App (and Tachyons for CSS which are neat).
Check it on desktop and mobile, as always!
